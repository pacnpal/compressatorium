"""Wrapper for the ``7z`` CLI, packing handheld ROM dumps into archives.

This tool losslessly compresses Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and
Nintendo DS ROM dumps (``.gb`` / ``.gbc`` / ``.gba`` / ``.nds``) into standard
``.7z`` (LZMA2) or ``.zip`` (deflate) archives, and extracts them back to the
exact original ROM. The ``7z`` binary ships in the image already (``p7zip-full``),
so no extra build step is needed; the read/metadata side reads members through
the shared, mtime-cached ``services.archive_members`` reader.

Three modes:

- ``romz_7z``      ``.gb``/``.gbc``/``.gba``/``.nds`` -> ``<name>.7z``
- ``romz_zip``     ``.gb``/``.gbc``/``.gba``/``.nds`` -> ``<name>.zip``
- ``romz_extract`` ``.7z``/``.zip`` (single ROM member) -> original ROM

Output names preserve the ROM extension (``Game.gba`` -> ``Game.gba.7z``), so the
round-trip is deterministic in both directions: extract simply restores the
single member. Compression strength is a Fast / Default / Max effort preset; Max
mirrors the reference ``-mx=9 -md=256m -mfb=273 -m0=lzma2`` profile.
