# Compressatorium

> **Fork notice:** This is a fork of MarcTV's Docker CHD Converter. It adds a Web UI and more conversion tools on top of the original CLI converter. Thanks to [MarcTV](https://github.com/MarcTV) for the original.

A game image converter that wraps seven tools: **CHDMAN** (MAME), **dolphin-tool** (Dolphin Emulator), **z3ds_compressor** (Nintendo 3DS), **nsz** (Nintendo Switch), **maxcso** (PSP/PS2 CSO/ZSO), **7z** (handheld ROM archives), and **makeps3iso** (PS3 decrypted folder → ISO). Pick the tool that matches your files and convert from a browser, or run it headless from the command line.

## Features

* **Seven tools in one.** CHDMAN, Dolphin, 3DS, Switch, CSO/ZSO, handheld ROM (GB/GBC/GBA/DS), or PS3 ISO (a decrypted PS3 folder packed to `.iso`), chosen per job.
* **Web UI** for browsing files and converting them. The tool picker filters the whole interface down to the tool you chose.
* **Nested directories and archives.** Browse subfolders and look inside ZIP, 7z, and RAR archives.
* **Multiple volume mounts** so you can keep separate game libraries separate.
* **File detection** that works out which files each tool can convert.
* **Existing-output detection** with skip, rename, or overwrite.
* **Delete-on-verify.** Optionally remove the source after a conversion verifies. Off by default.
* **Progress tracking** through a live job queue.
* **File info** for CHD, Dolphin, 3DS, Switch, CSO, and handheld ROM files.

### Supported Conversions

| Tool | Platform / Use | Input Formats | Output Formats | Compression Control | External Keys | Binary |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| **CHDMAN** | CD / DVD / HD / LaserDisc discs | .gdi, .cue, .bin, .iso, .chd | .chd, .cue, .bin, .iso, .raw, .avi | Codec list (zstd, zlib, …) | None | `mame-tools` |
| **Dolphin** | GameCube / Wii discs | .iso, .wbfs, .rvz, .wia, .gcz | .rvz, .wia, .gcz, .iso | Codec + numeric level | None | `dolphin-emu` |
| **3DS** | Nintendo 3DS ROMs | .cci, .cia, .3ds, .cxi, .3dsx, .zcci, .zcia, .z3ds, .zcxi, .z3dsx | .zcci, .zcia, .z3ds, .zcxi, .z3dsx, .cci, .cia, .3ds, .cxi, .3dsx | None (fixed) | None | `z3ds_compressor` |
| **Switch** | Nintendo Switch dumps | .nsp, .xci, .nsz, .xcz | .nsz, .xcz, .nsp, .xci | Layout + level | **Yes** (`prod.keys`) | `nsz` |
| **CSO** | PSP / PS2 game images | .iso, .cso, .zso, .dax | .cso, .zso, .dax, .iso | Effort preset (Fast/Default/Max) | None | `maxcso` |
| **Handheld ROM** | Game Boy / GBC / GBA / DS ROMs | .gb, .gbc, .gba, .nds, .7z, .zip | .7z, .zip, .gb, .gbc, .gba, .nds | Effort preset (Fast/Default/Max) | None | `7z` (p7zip-full) |
| **PS3 ISO** | Decrypted PS3 disc / JB folders | a folder containing `PS3_GAME/` (plus `PS3_DISC.SFB` for disc rips) | .iso (optional 4 GB FAT32 split) | None (fixed) | None | `makeps3iso` |

Most conversions above are lossless and fully reversible, including **3DS**, which
now decompresses back to the original ROM as well. This uses
[`z3ds_compress`](https://github.com/pacnpal/z3ds_compress) (a fork that adds a
decompression mode and `.cxi`/`.3dsx` support to the original
[`energeticokay/z3ds_compress`](https://github.com/energeticokay/z3ds_compress)).
The compressed `.z3ds` can be read directly by Azahar, or restored to
`.cci`/`.cia`/`.3ds` with `z3ds_decompress`; see
[Nintendo 3DS Support](#nintendo-3ds-support).

**PS3 ISO** is the exception to the round trip. It packs a decrypted PS3 folder
into a `.iso` that RPCS3 mounts directly; there is no reverse mode back to a
folder, and it never deletes the source. See
[PlayStation 3 Support](#playstation-3-support-folder--iso).

The CSO tool also has a one-step chain, `cso_to_chd`, that runs a `.cso`/`.zso`/`.dax`
through maxcso to a temporary `.iso` and then chdman to a `.chd` in a single job;
see [PSP / PS2 Support](#psp--ps2-support-cso--zso--dax).

Each tool's full mode list (e.g. CHDMAN's `createcd`/`extractcd`, CSO's
`cso2_compress`, the ROM packer's `romz_7z`/`romz_zip`/`romz_extract`, and the PS3
packer's `folder_to_iso`) is in [Supported Operations](#supported-operations).

> **Archive inputs:** most input formats above can be converted straight from inside a ZIP, 7z, or RAR archive, including 3DS ROMs, Dolphin game images, and Switch dumps. Browse into the archive, pick a member, and convert. This even covers CHDMAN's extract modes pulling a `.chd` out of an archive and decompressing it back to a game image. A few exceptions: CHDMAN's **copy/recompress** mode is not offered from an archive (recompressing an already-finished `.chd` would be a pointless round trip); **Handheld ROM** does not accept loose ROMs from inside an archive — its `.7z`/`.zip` are the packed product, so to unpack one select the archive file itself and run `romz_extract`, rather than browsing into it for a member; and **PS3 ISO** takes a folder, not a file, so it is never an archive input (a zipped `PS3_GAME` tree can't be converted from inside an archive).

### MAME Redump DAT Integration

Compressatorium can sync [MAME Redump](https://github.com/MetalSlug/MAMERedump) DAT files (Logiqx XML) in one click and check your compressed files against known-good Redump hashes. The same hashes let tools like [Hasheous](https://github.com/gaseous-project/hasheous) and [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) match your library.

- **One-click sync**: Click "Sync from MAME Redump" in the DAT panel to download all ~69 DATs automatically from GitHub
- **Auto-sync**: Set `MAMEREDUMP_AUTO_SYNC=true` to sync DATs on container startup when none are loaded
- **CHD files**: Matched via the embedded header / data SHA1 (codec-independent, works with any compression setting on chdman 0.285)
- **Dolphin RVZ/WIA/GCZ**: Matched via the game image's content SHA1 reconstructed by `dolphin-tool verify` — the same hash MAME Redump records for GameCube/Wii discs — so compressed Dolphin outputs match without the container bytes having to be identical
- **Everything else** (3DS/Switch/CSO·ZSO·DAX/`.iso`/`.bin`): Matched via file-level SHA1
- **Library scan**: The background scan discovers and DAT-matches tool outputs by extension (CHD, Dolphin RVZ/WIA/GCZ, 3DS, Switch, CSO/ZSO, `.iso`, and the `.bin` data track from CHDMAN extract), not just CHDs, so non-CHD libraries get cached match results too. A single PS3-packed `.iso` is matched like any other `.iso`; a 4 GB split set is not, since its `.iso.0`/`.iso.1` parts aren't scanned extensions. Heavy Dolphin disc-hashing during the scan honors `MATCH_MAX_FILE_SIZE` and stops promptly if you cancel the scan.
- **DAT management**: Import, list, and delete DATs via the web UI "DAT Files" button
- **Match badges**: Files matching a DAT entry show a blue "DAT" badge in the file list

## Installation

The Docker image is available from two registries:

### Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull pacnpal/compressatorium
```

### GitHub Container Registry

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/pacnpal/compressatorium
```

Both registries provide identical images with multi-architecture support (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`).

> **Note:** Use either registry: replace `pacnpal/compressatorium` with `ghcr.io/pacnpal/compressatorium` for the same image.

### Available Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` | Latest stable release |
| `beta` | Latest pre-release build (see warning below) |
| `X.Y.Z` | Specific stable version (e.g., `3.7.0`) |
| `X.Y.Z-beta-N` | Specific pre-release build (e.g., `3.7.0-beta-3`) |
| `sha-xxxxxxx` | Specific commit build |

### Opting in to beta updates

To track pre-release builds, pull the `:beta` tag instead of `:latest`:

```bash
docker pull pacnpal/compressatorium:beta
```

Or pin to a specific pre-release (recommended if you want to control when you upgrade):

```bash
docker pull pacnpal/compressatorium:3.7.0-beta-3
```

> **Warning: beta builds can cause data loss.** Pre-releases may carry unfinished migrations, experimental conversion logic, or breaking changes to the job database. Running a beta against a database that a stable release created can corrupt it or migrate it past the point of return, and downgrading back to `:latest` afterwards is **not supported**. Before you pull `:beta`:
>
> - Back up your SQLite database (`compressatorium.db` in your data volume) and any in-flight output files.
> - Prefer a separate data volume for beta testing rather than pointing a beta container at your production volume.
> - Do not use beta builds for batches you cannot afford to redo.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Select Your Primary Tool

When you open the Web UI, you'll see the tool options at the top:

* **CHDMAN** - For converting CD/DVD/LaserDisc images to CHD format
* **Dolphin** - For GameCube/Wii game image conversions
* **3DS** - For compressing Nintendo 3DS ROMs
* **Switch** - For compressing/decompressing Nintendo Switch dumps (needs your own prod.keys)
* **CSO** - For compressing/decompressing PSP/PS2 ISO images to CSO/ZSO (and a one-step CSO → CHD chain)
* **Handheld ROM** - For compressing/extracting GB/GBC/GBA/DS ROM dumps to .7z/.zip archives
* **PS3 ISO** - For packing a decrypted PS3 folder into a `.iso` RPCS3 can mount

**Choose the tool that matches your files.** The interface then shows only the modes and file types that tool can use.

### 2. Browse and Select Files

* Navigate through your mounted volumes using the left panel
* Click on folders to browse subdirectories
* Check the boxes next to files you want to convert
* Archives (.zip, .7z, .rar) can be browsed by clicking them
* With the **PS3 ISO** tool selected, a decrypted PS3 folder is itself selectable as a source (clicking its name still browses into it); the rest of the tools take files

### 3. Configure and Convert

* Select the appropriate conversion mode from the dropdown
* Adjust compression settings if available (see [Compression Settings](#compression-settings))
* Click the action button (Create/Convert/Compress depending on mode)
* Monitor progress in the job queue panel

## Usage Guide

This is the global guide to the workflow and the features shared by **every**
tool — browsing, modes, compression, verifying/deleting, archives, DAT matching,
and troubleshooting. The per-tool sections further down only document what's
specific to each tool (its formats, modes, env vars, and quirks). The same
material is available in-app under **Help**.

### Browsing and finding files

Your mounted volumes appear in the left panel — click a folder to enter, a
breadcrumb to go back. **Search All** walks the whole volume and lists every
convertible file at once; the **filter dropdown** narrows by extension. Both
update automatically as tools are added. System clutter (`.DS_Store`, AppleDouble
`._*` files, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `@eaDir`, `#recycle`, `lost+found`, …) is
hidden so listings stay clean.

### Modes

Create makes a compressed file, extract/decompress gives the original back, copy
recompresses in place. Pick the create mode that matches the media — compressing a
PSP/PS2 image with `createcd` instead of `createdvd` won't come out right. The
full mode list per tool is in [Supported Operations](#supported-operations).

### Compression settings

Every tool that compresses (CHD, Dolphin, Switch, CSO) shares one compression
picker in the convert panel:

* **Controls differ per tool.** chdman takes a codec list, Dolphin and Switch take
  a single codec/layout plus a numeric level, and CSO takes a Fast/Default/Max
  effort preset (no numeric level). Decompress/extract modes and 3DS have no
  compression settings, so the picker is hidden for them.
* **Your choice is remembered** server-side per tool, so it follows you across
  sessions and browsers.
* **Reset to default.** A button under the picker restores that tool's
  codec/layout/level/effort to its default and confirms with a toast. It's
  disabled when you're already on the defaults.
* **Strong defaults where it helps.** CSO defaults to the **Max** preset (smallest
  output); the other tools default to broadly-compatible settings (chdman `zlib`,
  Dolphin `zstd:19`, Switch `solid:18`). See also
  [Compression Compatibility Tips](#compression-compatibility-tips).

### Output location and duplicates

By default the output lands next to its source; set a custom output directory
instead and it's created for you as long as it's inside a mounted volume. If a
matching output already exists the app stops and asks rather than clobbering it:
**skip** keeps the existing file, **rename** writes under a new name, **overwrite**
replaces it.

### The job queue

Every conversion and verify runs through one FIFO queue — one job at a time by
default, which keeps the host responsive during big batches. Progress streams
live, and jobs run on the server, so closing the browser (or rebooting your
laptop) doesn't stop them; reopen the page and it reconnects. The queue has
active / completed / failed tabs, plus **Cancel All** and **Clear Done** (both
confirm first).

### Verifying and deleting safely

Converting never deletes anything on its own — the safe order is convert, verify,
then delete the source. Verify reads the whole output back and checks it against
the file's own hashes/CRC; with **delete-on-verify** the source is removed only
after the output passes, and never if it fails. You get a confirmation list of
everything to be deleted first, including the `.cue`/`.gdi` track files that ride
with a `.bin`, and the whole archive if the source came from one. **Bulk Verify**
checks a whole selection at once across CHD, Dolphin, 3DS, Switch, and CSO;
verification status persists between sessions, and a long verify can be given a
timeout so a stalled one doesn't block the queue.

### File info

Click a file to open the inspector — it shows the format/version, compression,
size, and hashes, plus the raw tool output. For PS1/PS2/PSP/Dreamcast discs it
also digs the game serial out of the sector data and shows a human title when it
recognizes one. A background scan caches this so the list badges don't recompute
on every folder open.

### DAT matching

Sync the MAMERedump DATs from the DAT Library (or import your own `.dat`/`.xml`
from No-Intro/Redump) and converted files are checked against known-good hashes —
a blue DAT badge means the file matches. CHDs match on the codec-independent header
SHA1, and Dolphin RVZ/WIA/GCZ match on the game image's content SHA1 reconstructed by
`dolphin-tool verify --algorithm sha1` (the same hash Redump records), so **any
compression setting still matches** for both. A missing badge usually means the DATs
aren't synced, the title isn't in the DAT, or the file is larger than
`MATCH_MAX_FILE_SIZE` (which skips the expensive full-disc reconstruction) — not that
the file is bad.

### Archives

Browse straight into a ZIP, 7z, or RAR and convert a file from inside it — no need
to extract first. The member is unpacked to a temp dir for the conversion and
cleaned up afterwards. Any convertible **source** works this way (CHD create,
Dolphin, 3DS, Switch, and CSO — Switch still needs your own `prod.keys`), and
CHDMAN's extract modes can even pull a `.chd` out of an archive and decompress it
back to a game image. The exception is CHDMAN's copy/recompress mode: it acts on a
finished `.chd`, and recompressing one straight out of an archive is a pointless
round trip, so it's not offered there.

#### Why only certain files show inside an archive

Browsing into an archive does **not** list everything it contains. It lists the
file types the app *knows* — every extension that some tool recognizes as a
convertible source (`.iso`, `.cue`/`.bin`, `.gdi`, `.gcz`/`.wia`/`.rvz`/`.wbfs`,
`.cci`/`.cia`/`.3ds`/`.cxi`/`.3dsx`, `.nsp`/`.xci`, `.cso`/`.zso`/`.dax`, the handheld ROMs
`.gb`/`.gbc`/`.gba`/`.nds`, …) plus a `.chd` you can decompress in place. Anything
else is hidden, on purpose:

- **Unknown files are filtered out.** Read-me text, `.nfo`/`.sfv` files, box art,
  manuals, save states — none of it is something the app can convert or verify, so
  it would only be clutter in the browser. The listing is *global, scoped to known
  extensions*: a member shows up if and only if its extension is one the app
  understands, regardless of which tool you currently have selected.
- **Nested archives are hidden.** A `.zip` inside a `.zip` (or `.7z`/`.rar`) is not
  listed — there's no point browsing an archive within an archive.
- **OS/NAS clutter is ignored.** macOS `__MACOSX/…` resource forks, `.DS_Store`,
  `Thumbs.db` and the like never appear, so a ROM zipped on a Mac or Windows box
  still reads as a clean single-file archive.

Some members that *are* shown still can't be converted from inside the archive,
and the UI badges them non-convertible:

- **A handheld ROM packed by this app** (`Game.gba` inside `Game.gba.7z`) is shown
  so you can see and verify it, but it isn't offered for re-conversion —
  recompressing an already-archived ROM would just be packing a `.7z` into another
  `.7z`. To unpack it, select the archive file itself and run `romz_extract`.
- **A `.chd` inside an archive** can be *decompressed* in place (chdman's extract
  modes), but it can't be recompressed — it's already a finished CHD, so chdman's
  copy/recompress mode is deliberately not offered from an archive.

In short: if a file you expect isn't in the list, it's almost always because its
extension isn't one of the convertible/verifiable types the app handles. Loose
files on disk follow the same rule — the file list filters to the types the
selected tool understands.

### Troubleshooting

* **An emulator won't read the CHD** — almost always the codec; recompress with
  `zlib` only using copy mode (see [Compression Compatibility Tips](#compression-compatibility-tips)).
* **"Output already exists"** — pick skip / rename / overwrite; nothing is
  replaced unless you choose overwrite.
* **A conversion stalls** — big files are slow; an adaptive stall timeout scales
  with input size, and the queue has a recovery action. Check temp-dir space/speed.
* **A file didn't show up** — make sure the right tool is selected (the list filters
  to it); try Search All or clear the extension filter.
* **An ISO went to the wrong tool** — ISOs can belong to CHDMAN or Dolphin; set the
  ISO Handling toggle to match the disc.
* **The Switch tool is missing or jobs ask for prod.keys** — it needs your own
  keys; see [Nintendo Switch Support](#nintendo-switch-support). Without keys the
  tool is hidden.

## Web UI Mode (Default)

The web interface is the easiest way to run Compressatorium:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PUID=$(id -u) \
  -e PGID=$(id -g) \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/games:/data/games \
  pacnpal/compressatorium
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.

> **Required:** The `/config` volume must be mounted for persistent data storage.  
> **Volume discovery:** If `COMPRESSATORIUM_VOLUMES` is unset, the app scans `/data/*` at startup and auto-registers mounted game volumes (restart after mount changes).  
> **Ownership (optional):** Set `PUID`/`PGID` to match your host user/group (for example Unraid `99:100`). If unset, defaults remain `999:999`.  
> **Default temp location:** `/config/temp`. To use a different location, set `CHD_TEMP_DIR` and mount it.

### Multiple Volumes

Mount multiple game directories for better organization:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /home/user/dreamcast:/data/dreamcast \
  -v /home/user/psp:/data/psp \
  -v /home/user/ps1:/data/ps1 \
  pacnpal/compressatorium
```

### Custom Output Directory

In the Web UI, you can specify a custom output directory for converted CHD, Dolphin, or 3DS outputs instead of placing them alongside the source files. The directory will be created automatically as long as it is within your configured volumes.

### Screenshots

The Web UI ships with light and dark themes and is fully responsive from desktop down to phones. Each surface below is shown as a light / dark pair.

#### Workspace

A three-pane layout: navigation and tool picker on the left, the volume and file browser in the middle, and a live convert panel with the job queue on the right. Selecting a tool refilters the file list and the convert options to match.

#### Responsive layouts

The interface reflows cleanly across breakpoints:

**Desktop (1280px)**

**Tablet (768px)**

![Tablet View](docs/screenshots/docs-tablet-view.png)

**Mobile (375px)**

On small screens the file list switches to a card layout. Controls use 44 to 48px touch targets, inputs go full width, and the spacing opens up so it stays usable on a phone.

### Features

**File Browser**
- Navigate through mounted volumes and subdirectories
- View file sizes, types, ISO handling, and CHD status indicators
- Recursive search to find all convertible files across the entire volume

**Archive Support**
- Browse inside ZIP, 7z, and RAR archives without extraction
- Convert files directly from within archives
- Archives extract temporarily during conversion, then clean up automatically
- When a `.cue`/`.gdi` is present in the same archive folder, `.bin` entries are suppressed and batch jobs are deduplicated by output path to avoid stalled conversions.
- Archive listings include safety limits (max entries/size) and expose truncation metadata when limits are hit.
- **Browsing is global, scoped to known extensions.** When you look inside an archive, the listing shows every member whose extension is one the app understands — every tool's convertible source plus a `.chd` you can decompress — regardless of which tool is currently selected. That covers CHDMAN (`.gdi`/`.iso`/`.cue`/`.bin`), Dolphin (`.iso`/`.gcz`/`.wia`/`.rvz`/`.wbfs`), 3DS (`.cci`/`.cia`/`.3ds`/`.cxi`/`.3dsx`), Switch (`.nsp`/`.xci`), CSO (`.iso`/`.cso`/`.zso`/`.dax`), and Handheld ROM (`.gb`/`.gbc`/`.gba`/`.nds`). Archive members appear for whichever tool accepts them, exactly like on-disk files.
- **Why everything else is hidden.** Unknown files (text, `.nfo`/`.sfv`, cover art, manuals), nested archives (a `.zip` inside a `.zip`), and OS/NAS clutter (`__MACOSX/…`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) are filtered out — they aren't convertible or verifiable, so listing them would only be noise. See [Archives → Why only certain files show inside an archive](#why-only-certain-files-show-inside-an-archive).
- **Some shown members are view-only.** A handheld ROM this app packed (`Game.gba` inside `Game.gba.7z`) is listed for visibility/verification but not offered for re-conversion (recompressing an archived ROM would be recursive); unpack it by selecting the archive and running `romz_extract`. A `.chd` inside an archive can be decompressed in place but not recompressed (copy/recompress acts on a finished output). Such members are badged non-convertible.
- The only inputs that can't come from an archive are CHDMAN's copy/recompress mode (recompressing an already-finished `.chd` would be a pointless round trip — though the extract modes *can* decompress a `.chd` straight out of an archive) and Handheld ROM compression, whose `.7z`/`.zip` are the packed product.

**ISO Handling & Dolphin Tools (GameCube/Wii)**
- Toggle ISO handling between CHDMAN and Dolphin (controls ISO info/verify and conversions)
- Convert `.iso`, `.gcz`, `.wia`, `.rvz`, `.wbfs` with dolphin-tool (RVZ/WIA/GCZ/ISO output)
- Disc info and verification for Dolphin formats (including batch verification)
- Dolphin sources may be converted directly from inside ZIP/7z/RAR archives (extracted to a temp dir for the conversion, then cleaned up)

**Batch Conversion**
- Select multiple files and convert them all at once
- Queue-based processing (FIFO), defaulting to serial execution (`MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=1`)
- Real-time progress tracking via Server-Sent Events
- Duplicate detection with options to skip, rename, or overwrite
- Optional delete-on-verify with a preflight confirmation list (includes `.cue`/`.gdi` track files)
- Archive conversions can delete the entire archive after verify (explicit warning in the delete plan)
- Job manager controls include **Cancel All** and **Clear Done**, both guarded by confirmation dialogs

**Bulk Operations**
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete multiple selected files at once
- **Bulk Verify**: Verify integrity of multiple CHD + Dolphin images simultaneously
- Sorts sources by whether they already have a CHD backup
- Warnings for files without verified CHD backups before deletion

**Verification**
- Verify CHD files using chdman's built-in verification
- Verify GameCube/Wii game images using dolphin-tool (ISO uses Dolphin when ISO handling is set to Dolphin)
- Verification status persisted across sessions (stored in `/config/verified_chds.json`)
- Integrated verification workflow when deleting source files
- Visual indicators showing verified vs unverified items
- Optional timeouts for long-running verifications and stalled progress

**CHD Inspector**
- View detailed CHD file information (version, compression, size, hashes)
- SHA1 and Data SHA1 checksums displayed
- Raw chdman output available for advanced inspection
- Dolphin disc info shows game ID, region, format, compression, and raw output
- **Game ID and title.** PS1, PS2, PSP, and Dreamcast serials are read from CHD sector data (SYSTEM.CNF, PARAM.SFO, IP.BIN) and shown in the info modal, with human-readable titles when available (for example "Patapon", "DEAD OR ALIVE 2")

**CHD Metadata Cache**
- Background metadata scan with CD/DVD badges
- **Retroactive game ID tagging.** The scan writes `GAME` and `NAME` tags into existing CHDs that lack them. Later scans skip files that are already tagged
- "Scan Metadata" and "Force Rescan" actions to refresh cached metadata
- Cache stored in `/config/chd_metadata.json`

**File Management**
- Rename files and directories
- Delete files with safety checks (warns about missing CHD backups)
- Empty directory cleanup

**Conversion Modes**
- **Create CHD**: createcd (CD), createdvd (DVD/PSP/PS2), createraw, createhd, createld
- **Extract from CHD**: extractcd, extractdvd, extractraw, extracthd, extractld
- **Copy/Recompress**: Recompress existing CHD files with different codecs
- **Dolphin (GameCube/Wii)**: dolphin_rvz, dolphin_wia, dolphin_gcz, dolphin_iso

**Compression Options**
- Choose from multiple compression codecs: zlib, zstd, lzma, huff, flac, avhu (A/V Huffman)
- CD-specific codecs: cdzl, cdzs, cdlz, cdfl (CD images only)
- No compression option for maximum compatibility (`-c none`)
- Select up to 4 codecs per conversion (CHD only)
- Dolphin modes accept one codec + optional level (RVZ/WIA), while GCZ/ISO ignore compression

---

## Dolphin Emulator Support (GameCube/Wii)

Dolphin support is available in the Web UI and REST API (CLI mode remains CHDMAN-only).

**Supported inputs:** `.iso`, `.gcz`, `.wia`, `.rvz`, `.wbfs`  
**Output modes:** `dolphin_rvz` (recommended), `dolphin_wia`, `dolphin_gcz`, `dolphin_iso`

**Notes** (shared workflow — compression, verify, archives — is in the [Usage Guide](#usage-guide))
- Requires the Docker image with Dolphin installed (default image includes `dolphin-emu` + wrapper).
- Dolphin conversions use `dolphin-tool` (configurable via `DOLPHIN_TOOL_PATH`).
- Compression is a single codec plus an optional level (`zstd:5`, `bzip2:5`, `lzma:5`, `lzma2:5`); `zstd:19` is the default. `dolphin_gcz` uses fixed compression (ignores the codec), and `dolphin_iso` outputs an uncompressed ISO.
- ISO info/verify and conversions follow the **ISO Handling** toggle in the UI (no default — you must choose, since an ISO can belong to CHDMAN or Dolphin).

## Nintendo 3DS Support

3DS ROM compression **and decompression** are available in the Web UI and REST
API using [z3ds_compress](https://github.com/pacnpal/z3ds_compress) — a fork of
the original [`energeticokay/z3ds_compress`](https://github.com/energeticokay/z3ds_compress)
that adds a decompression mode and support for `.cxi`/`.3dsx` files.

Select **3DS** as the primary tool, pick your files, and choose a mode:
**Compress 3DS** (`z3ds_compress`) packs a raw ROM, and **Decompress 3DS**
(`z3ds_decompress`) restores the original ROM from a Z3DS file. The general
workflow (queue, verify, delete-on-verify, archives) is in the
[Usage Guide](#usage-guide); the 3DS-specific bits are below.

> **Round-trip is lossless.** The compressed `.z3ds`/`.zcci`/`.zcia` is a
> seekable-Zstandard container that Azahar reads directly, *and* it can be
> decompressed back to a byte-identical original. Direction is chosen by the
> mode (we pass the tool's explicit `-c`/`-d` flag), so it never depends on
> guessing from the file contents.

### Supported File Formats

**Compress inputs (raw ROMs):**
- **`.cci`** - CCI (CTR Card Image) format - Nintendo 3DS cartridge dumps
- **`.cia`** - CIA (CTR Importable Archive) format - Installable packages, updates, DLC
- **`.3ds`** - Alternative extension for cartridge dumps (identical to .cci, can be renamed)
- **`.cxi`** - CXI (CTR Executable Image) - experimental
- **`.3dsx`** - 3DSX homebrew executable - experimental

**Compressed outputs / decompress inputs (Z3DS containers):**
- **`.zcci`** ↔ `.cci`
- **`.zcia`** ↔ `.cia`
- **`.z3ds`** ↔ `.3ds`
- **`.zcxi`** ↔ `.cxi`
- **`.z3dsx`** ↔ `.3dsx`

**Important Note:** The `.3ds` and `.cci` formats are functionally identical - they're both cartridge dump formats with different file extensions. You can freely rename between them. The z3ds_compress tool supports both extensions and maintains the naming convention (.3ds → .z3ds, .cci → .zcci, and the reverse on decompress).

### Technical Details

**Compression method:** Seekable ZStandard (256KB frame size)  
**Size reduction:** Typically **~50%** without compatibility issues  
**Compression speed:** Fast, single-threaded processing

**Compatibility:**
- Compressed ROMs are **natively supported** by [Azahar emulator](https://azahar-emu.org/) (release 2123+)
- **`.cci` files:** Thoroughly tested and production-ready
- **`.cia` files:** Supported but considered experimental
- **`.3ds` files:** Same as .cci - fully supported (they're the same format)

**3DS-specific notes:**
- z3ds_compressor binary ships in the Docker image (`Z3DS_COMPRESSOR_PATH=/usr/local/bin/z3ds_compressor`), built from the [pacnpal/z3ds_compress](https://github.com/pacnpal/z3ds_compress) fork via CMake.
- Compression settings are **fixed** — 3DS is the one tool with no compression picker.
- ROMs must be **decrypted** before compression (encrypted ROMs will not work).
- Decompression (`z3ds_decompress`) does not offer delete-on-verify: the restored ROM is not itself a verify-class file, so the compressed source can't be confirmed before deletion.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Z3DS_COMPRESSOR_PATH` | `/usr/local/bin/z3ds_compressor` | Path to z3ds_compressor binary |

(Global vars — DAT sync, tool paths, priority — are in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).)

### REST API Endpoints

- `POST /api/jobs` or `POST /api/jobs/batch` - Queue 3DS jobs (use `mode: "z3ds_compress"` or `mode: "z3ds_decompress"`)
- `GET /api/z3ds-info?path=/path/to/rom.cci` - Get file information (size, format, compression status)
- `GET /api/z3ds-verify?path=/path/to/rom.zcci` - Verify compressed 3DS output integrity
- `GET /api/z3ds-verify/events?path=/path/to/rom.zcci` - SSE stream for 3DS verify progress
- `POST /api/z3ds-verify-batch/events` - SSE stream for batch 3DS verification

(DAT sync/import/match endpoints are shared — see [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints).)

## Nintendo Switch Support

Switch compression and decompression use [nsz](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz),
the homebrew-standard tool. It shrinks `.nsp`/`.xci` dumps into `.nsz`/`.xcz`
(40-80% smaller) and reverses the process. Compressed output stays installable
in Tinfoil and DBI.

> **You must provide your own `prod.keys`.** Switch game content (the NCA files
> inside an NSP/XCI) is encrypted, and encrypted data does not compress. nsz
> decrypts the content, compresses it, and stores how to re-encrypt it so
> decompression rebuilds a byte-identical original. That decrypt step needs your
> console's keys. **This app ships no keys and nsz ships no keys.** You supply
> your own, dumped from a console you own, for games you own. Without keys, the
> Switch tool is hidden from the UI entirely. See the legal note at the bottom
> of this section.

### How to Use

**Provide keys first** (see [Keys: setup and security](#keys-setup-and-security)) —
the Switch tool only appears once `prod.keys` are found. Then select **Switch**,
choose *Compress* (`.nsp`/`.xci` → `.nsz`/`.xcz`) or *Decompress*, and convert. The
general workflow is in the [Usage Guide](#usage-guide).

### Supported File Formats

* **`.nsp`** - Nintendo Submission Package (eShop-style dump)
* **`.xci`** - Cartridge image (game card dump)
* **`.nsz`** - Compressed NSP (zstandard over decrypted NCA content)
* **`.xcz`** - Compressed XCI

Compress maps `.nsp` → `.nsz` and `.xci` → `.xcz`; decompress reverses it.

### Compression (layout and level)

The Compress mode exposes two controls in the convert panel, per job:

* **Layout** - *Solid* (best ratio; must be decompressed to run) or *Block*
  (slightly larger, but installable/playable without full decompression).
* **Level** - the zstandard level, 1-22.

Your choice is remembered server-side (per tool), so it persists across
sessions and browsers. `NSZ_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` is the fallback default when no
per-job level is set. (See [Compression Settings](#compression-settings) for the
shared picker behavior, including the Reset-to-default button.)

### Technical Details

* nsz is installed from pip and runs as a subprocess (no shell). Verify uses
  nsz's own `-V` integrity check on the compressed container.
* The compress/decompress round trip is lossless. nsz keeps all protection
  measures in place (the first 0x4000 bytes of each NCZ stay encrypted, and the
  NCZ header records how to re-encrypt), so decompression reproduces the
  original byte-for-byte.
* Archive inputs work, but your own `prod.keys` are still required exactly as for
  on-disk files.

### Keys: setup and security

* **Recommended:** mount the directory holding your keys read-only and set
  `SWITCH_KEYS` to it:

  ```yaml
  # docker-compose.yml
  services:
    compressatorium:
      environment:
        - SWITCH_KEYS=/keys           # directory containing prod.keys
      volumes:
        - /host/path/to/switch-keys:/keys:ro
  ```

* `SWITCH_KEYS` is the source of truth when set (its directory is checked
  directly, then searched recursively). When unset, the app best-effort searches
  the standard locations (`~/.switch`, the nsz config dirs) and then recursively
  walks your mounted game volumes for a `prod.keys`/`keys.txt`, skipping junk
  dirs and bounded by a directory cap so a huge library can't stall startup. Set
  `SWITCH_KEYS` if your keys live very deep.
* Keys are never baked into the image and are git-ignored, so a stray copy can't
  be committed. The file only needs to be readable by uid 999 (`converter`).
* Keys are never logged.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NSZ_PATH` | `nsz` | Path to the nsz binary (resolved on PATH by default) |
| `SWITCH_KEYS` | *(unset)* | Directory holding your `prod.keys`. Source of truth when set; otherwise a best-effort search of `~/.switch` and your volumes runs at startup. |
| `NSZ_COMPRESSION_LEVEL` | `18` | Fallback zstandard level (1-22) when no per-job level is set in the UI |

### REST API Endpoints

* `POST /api/jobs` or `POST /api/jobs/batch` - Queue Switch jobs (use `mode: "nsz_compress"` or `"nsz_decompress"`; optional `compression: "solid:18"` / `"block:20"`)
* `GET /api/nsz-info?path=/path/to/game.nsp` - Get file information (size, format, compression status)
* `GET /api/nsz-verify?path=/path/to/game.nsz` - Verify a compressed Switch output
* `GET /api/nsz-verify/events?path=/path/to/game.nsz` - SSE stream for Switch verify progress
* `POST /api/nsz-verify-batch/events` - SSE stream for batch Switch verification

### Legal note

Compress only games you own, using keys you dumped from your own console. You
are responsible for how you use this tool. The project distributes no Nintendo
keys, firmware, or copyrighted game data.

## PSP / PS2 Support (CSO / ZSO / DAX)

CSO/ZSO/DAX compression and decompression use [maxcso](https://github.com/unknownbrackets/maxcso),
the standard PSP/PS2 ISO compressor. It shrinks `.iso` game images into `.cso`,
`.zso`, or `.dax` (and reverses the process). PPSSPP (PSP) and PCSX2 (PS2) read these
compressed formats directly, so the compressed file plays without a separate
decompress step. No keys are required.

### How to Use

Select **CSO** as the primary tool and pick a mode (the general workflow is in the
[Usage Guide](#usage-guide)):

- *Compress ISO → CSO* (`.iso` → `.cso`, CSO v1, the universally-supported default, deflate-based)
- *Compress ISO → CSO v2* (`.iso` → `.cso`, CSO v2, better block alignment; needs a recent PPSSPP/PCSX2)
- *Compress ISO → ZSO* (`.iso` → `.zso`, lz4-based, faster to decode)
- *Compress ISO → DAX* (`.iso` → `.dax`, legacy PSP format)
- *Decompress CSO/ZSO/DAX → ISO* (`.cso`/`.zso`/`.dax` → `.iso`)
- *Convert to CHD* (`cso_to_chd`: `.cso`/`.zso`/`.dax` → `.chd` in one step)

**CSO → CHD in one step.** The `cso_to_chd` mode runs the whole chain as a single
job: maxcso decompresses the compressed image to a temporary `.iso`, then chdman
packages that to a `.chd` (PPSSPP, PCSX2, and RetroArch read the result). The
intermediate `.iso` lives in a private temp dir and is cleaned up after, so only
the source and the final `.chd` remain. Delete-on-verify works end to end: the
original `.cso` is removed only after the final `.chd` passes chdman verification.
Disc-ID `GAME`/`NAME` tags are embedded into the CHD just like a direct Create
DVD. The chain uses chdman's default compression (there is no codec picker for it
yet).

### Supported File Formats

* **`.iso`** - Raw PSP/PS2 game image (compress source)
* **`.cso`** - Compressed ISO (CISO, deflate); CSO v1 and v2 share this extension
* **`.zso`** - Compressed ISO (lz4, faster decompression)
* **`.dax`** - Legacy compressed ISO (compress target and decompress source)

### Technical Details

* maxcso is built from source into the image and runs as a subprocess (no shell).
  Compression is lossless and fully reversible; the round trip reproduces the
  original `.iso` byte-for-byte. Verify runs maxcso's `--crc` over the compressed
  container (it decompresses the whole file and checks its CRC32).
* The output **format is chosen by the mode** (CSO v1 `--format` default, CSO v2
  `--format=cso2`, ZSO `--format=zso`, DAX `--format=dax`). Compress modes also take
  an **effort** preset — there is no numeric level (maxcso has none):
  * **Fast** - `--fast` (basic zlib/lz4): fastest, largest output.
  * **Default** - maxcso's default trials (zlib + 7zdeflate for the deflate-based
    CSO/CSO2/DAX formats, lz4hc for ZSO).
  * **Max** - smallest output, slowest: `--use-zopfli --use-libdeflate` for
    CSO/CSO2/DAX, `--use-lz4brute` for ZSO. **CSO defaults to Max.**
* **Which format?** Use plain **CSO** (v1) when in doubt — every PPSSPP/PCSX2 reads
  it. Pick **ZSO** for fastest decode (lz4), **CSO v2** for the best size on recent
  emulators, and **DAX** only for legacy tools that require it.
* An `.iso` row can be handled by CHDMAN, Dolphin, or CSO; the primary-tool picker
  decides which one acts on it.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAXCSO_PATH` | `/usr/local/bin/maxcso` | Path to the maxcso binary |

### REST API Endpoints

* `POST /api/jobs` or `POST /api/jobs/batch` - Queue CSO jobs (use `mode: "cso_compress"`, `"cso2_compress"`, `"zso_compress"`, `"dax_compress"`, `"cso_decompress"`, or `"cso_to_chd"`)
* `GET /api/cso-info?path=/path/to/game.cso` - Get file information (size, format, compression status)
* `GET /api/cso-verify?path=/path/to/game.cso` - Verify a compressed CSO/ZSO/DAX output
* `GET /api/cso-verify/events?path=/path/to/game.cso` - SSE stream for CSO verify progress
* `POST /api/cso-verify-batch/events` - SSE stream for batch CSO verification

## PlayStation 3 Support (folder → ISO)

The PS3 ISO tool packs a decrypted PS3 disc or JB folder into a single `.iso`
that RPCS3 mounts directly, using [makeps3iso](https://github.com/bucanero/ps3iso-utils).
This is the one tool whose input is a folder, not a file, and the one conversion
that is not reversible. It repackages a folder you already decrypted. It does not
decrypt anything and needs no keys.

### How to Use

Select **PS3 ISO** as the primary tool. A decrypted PS3 folder then shows up as a
selectable source in the file browser and in Search All (clicking its name still
browses into it). Pick the folder and run the one mode, `folder_to_iso`. The
output is `<folder>.iso` next to the source, or in a custom output directory
inside a mounted volume. The general workflow (queue, output handling) is in the
[Usage Guide](#usage-guide).

A folder qualifies when it has the decrypted PS3 layout: a `PS3_GAME/` directory,
plus `PS3_DISC.SFB` for disc rips. A bare installed-game folder is not accepted.

### Optional 4 GB split for FAT32

FAT32 can't hold a single file larger than 4 GB, so most PS3 discs won't fit as
one `.iso`. The per-job **Split into 4 GB parts (FAT32)** toggle runs makeps3iso
with `-s`, so an image over ~4 GB is written as `Game.iso.0`, `Game.iso.1`, and so
on (RPCS3 mounts the `.0`). A title under 4 GB still produces a single `Game.iso`.
The file browser folds a split set into one entry, showing `Game.iso` with the
combined size and a part count rather than a row per chunk. The toggle is off by
default; ext4, NTFS, and exFAT targets don't need it.

### Notes

- makeps3iso has no native verify, so there is no verify or delete-on-verify for
  this tool. After a successful build it does a light PARAM.SFO `TITLE_ID`
  readback from the produced ISO and flags a mismatch in the job message.
- While a folder is being packed, its whole subtree is locked. A per-file job
  that was already queued and whose input or output lands inside the folder is
  deferred, re-queued, and retried once the build finishes (only reachable with
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS > 1`). A new request whose output lands inside the folder
  is rejected up front like any output collision.
- The default output (`<folder>.iso`) must land inside a configured volume. If the
  folder is itself a volume root, so the sibling output would escape every volume,
  the job is rejected with a message asking for an in-volume output directory.
- The makeps3iso binary (GPL-3.0, from `bucanero/ps3iso-utils`) is built into the
  Docker image and builds on both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAKEPS3ISO_PATH` | `/usr/local/bin/makeps3iso` | Path to the makeps3iso binary |

(Global vars, including the tool-neutral priority knobs, are in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).)

### REST API Endpoints

- `POST /api/jobs` or `POST /api/jobs/batch` - Queue a PS3 ISO job. Use `mode: "folder_to_iso"` with the PS3 folder as the input path (`file_path` for a single job, `file_paths` for a batch), plus an optional `split: true` for the 4 GB FAT32 split.

There is no info or verify endpoint for this tool, since makeps3iso has no native
verify.

---

## CLI Mode (Batch Processing)

For automated/headless conversion, use CLI mode. CLI mode runs CHDMAN only and processes
files in the **top level** of each mounted volume (no recursive scanning, no archives). See
`DOCKER-COMPOSE.md` for CLI behavior details.

### CD Conversion (Default)

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e CHD_MODE=cli \
  -v "$(pwd)/isofiles:/data/games:rw" \
  pacnpal/compressatorium
```

### DVD Conversion (PSP, PS2)

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e CHD_MODE=cli \
  -e CHDMAN_MODE=createdvd \
  -v "$(pwd)/isofiles:/data/games:rw" \
  pacnpal/compressatorium
```

### Multiple Volumes in CLI Mode

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e CHD_MODE=cli \
  -e CHDMAN_MODE=createdvd \
  -v /home/user/psp:/data/psp:rw \
  -v /home/user/ps2:/data/ps2:rw \
  pacnpal/compressatorium
```

---

## Check Existing CHD Files

Using the chdman info command directly:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "/path/to/games:/data/games:ro" \
  --entrypoint chdman \
  pacnpal/compressatorium \
  info -i "/data/games/game.chd"
```

Or use the Web UI's CHD Inspector feature by clicking on any `.chd` file.

---

## Compression Compatibility Tips

Some emulators (notably NetherSX2/AetherSX2) only support **zlib**-compressed CHDs. If you see
errors like “Failed to initialize cdvd,” re-convert with **zlib only**.

- **zlib**: best compatibility across emulators
- **zstd**: fast + small, but older software may not support it
- **lzma**: highest compression, slowest
- **No compression**: uses `-c none` for uncompressed output
- **CD-specific codecs**: use cdzl/cdzs/cdlz/cdfl for CD images only

For Dolphin formats, choose a single codec (zstd/bzip2/lzma/lzma2) and an optional level.
Use `chdman help createcd` or `chdman help createdvd` for codec details.

---

## Supported Operations

All actions are queued and processed by the job queue (FIFO). The queue is the only execution path.

**Create CHD**
- `createraw`, `createhd`, `createcd`, `createdvd`, `createld`

**Extract from CHD**
- `extractraw`, `extracthd`, `extractcd`, `extractdvd`, `extractld`

**Copy / Recompress**
- `copy` (CHD → CHD, optionally with new compression)

**Dolphin (GameCube/Wii)**
- `dolphin_rvz`, `dolphin_wia`, `dolphin_gcz`, `dolphin_iso`

**Nintendo 3DS**
- `z3ds_compress` (.cci → .zcci, .cia → .zcia, .3ds → .z3ds, .cxi → .zcxi, .3dsx → .z3dsx)
- `z3ds_decompress` (.zcci → .cci, .zcia → .cia, .z3ds → .3ds, .zcxi → .cxi, .z3dsx → .3dsx)

**PSP / PS2 (CSO)**
- `cso_compress` (.iso → .cso, CSO v1), `cso2_compress` (.iso → .cso, CSO v2), `zso_compress` (.iso → .zso), `dax_compress` (.iso → .dax), `cso_decompress` (.cso/.zso/.dax → .iso), `cso_to_chd` (.cso/.zso/.dax → .chd, one-step chain through maxcso + chdman)

**Handheld ROM (GB/GBC/GBA/NDS)**
- `romz_7z` (.gb/.gbc/.gba/.nds → .7z), `romz_zip` (.gb/.gbc/.gba/.nds → .zip), `romz_extract` (.7z/.zip → original ROM)

**PS3 ISO (decrypted folder)**
- `folder_to_iso` (a folder containing `PS3_GAME/` → `<folder>.iso`, with an optional `-s` 4 GB FAT32 split)

Notes:
- Compression settings apply to CHD **create**/**copy**, Dolphin RVZ/WIA, Switch (`nsz_compress`), the CSO/CSO v2/ZSO/DAX compress modes, and the handheld ROM compress modes (`romz_7z`/`romz_zip`) — the last two take an effort preset. Other modes ignore them.
- Extract/decompress operations ignore compression settings.
- `extractcd` produces both `.cue` and `.bin` outputs.
- Dolphin GCZ/ISO outputs ignore compression selection.
- 3DS compression uses fixed settings (no user configuration needed).
- Archive inputs are supported for every convertible source (CHD create, Dolphin, 3DS, Switch, and CSO), plus CHDMAN's extract modes decompressing a `.chd` pulled out of an archive. The exception is CHDMAN's copy/recompress mode, which would just re-compress an already-finished `.chd`.

| `CHD_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_CAP` | `7200` | Upper bound for adaptive conversion stall timeout (0 disables cap) |
| `STATIC_DIR` | `/static` | Path to static web assets |

Defaults are intentionally conservative to reduce host impact during conversion. Increase `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` or adjust `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_*` only if your host has ample CPU/RAM and fast storage. By default temp files go to `/config/temp`; set `CHD_TEMP_DIR` to use a faster disk and mount it into the container.

## Persistent Data

The `/config` volume is **required** and must be mounted for the application to store persistent data.

```bash
-v /path/to/config:/config
```

### Data Files

| File | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `compressatorium.db` | `/config/` | SQLite database holding DAT index, hash match cache, CHD metadata cache, verification records, and DAT-sync state. Override path with `COMPRESSATORIUM_DB_PATH`. |
| `*.json.migrated.bak` | `/config/` | Legacy JSON stores, preserved as read-only backups after the one-time SQLite migration on first upgrade. Safe to delete once you've confirmed the app is working. |

#### First-run migration from JSON

On the first startup after upgrading from a JSON-backed install, the app imports `dat_store.json`, `verified_chds.json`, `chd_metadata.json`, and `dat_sync.json` into the new SQLite database. The originals are renamed to `<name>.migrated.bak` and never deleted, so you can always roll back. Migration is transactional, idempotent, and checks row counts. A failed or corrupt file is quarantined with a `.corrupt` suffix and the other stores still migrate.

#### Schema changes (for developers)

Schema is managed by [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/). On every startup:

1. If the DB already has an `alembic_version` row, Alembic runs `upgrade head`.
2. If the DB has the baseline tables but no `alembic_version` (pre-Alembic install), Alembic stamps the baseline revision (`0001`) and then runs `upgrade head` if later migrations are present. Alembic will create the `alembic_version` table as part of this process.
3. If the DB is empty, Alembic initializes it by applying the migration chain up to `head`.

To evolve the schema:

```bash
scripts/new_migration.sh "add foo column to dats"
# review migrations/versions/NNNN_*.py
# commit the new migration alongside your ORM changes
```

The test `test_no_model_drift_after_upgrade` fails if `Base.metadata` drifts from the migration chain. It runs on every test run and catches forgotten migrations.

### Ephemeral Runtime Data

The application also uses a non-persistent directory for runtime lock files:

| File / Directory | Location | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| `locks/` | `/tmp/chd-locks` | Job lock files (ephemeral, stored outside `/config` and automatically cleaned on container restart) |

---

## Docker Compose

The repository includes ready-to-use Docker Compose configurations:

- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Single volume setup with subdirectory support
- **`docker-compose.multi-volume.yml`** - Multiple separate volume mounts
- **`docker-compose.cli.yml`** - CLI/batch processing mode

### Quick Start

1. **Single Volume Setup** (recommended for most users):
   - Mount a top-level directory containing your games in subdirectories
   - The Web UI will recursively browse all subdirectories
   
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The default compose files include conservative CPU/memory limits to help avoid host lockups during large conversions. Adjust those limits to match your system.

### Tuning and Host Recommendations

**How to change settings**
- **Docker Compose:** edit `docker-compose.yml` (or `docker-compose.multi-volume.yml`) and update `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`, `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_*` (priority/timeout), and the `deploy.resources` limits.
- **Docker run / Unraid:** set environment variables in the container template and apply CPU/memory limits there.

**Recommended starting points**
- **Low/medium hosts (≤16 GB RAM, HDD or parity-backed arrays):** keep `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=1`, `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_NICE=10`, `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_IOPRIO_CLASS=2`, `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_IOPRIO_LEVEL=6`. Set a container memory limit (8–12 GB).
- **Faster hosts (32+ GB RAM, SSD cache):** try `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=2` and a higher memory limit (16–24 GB). Raise I/O priority only if the host remains responsive.
- **If the host becomes sluggish:** lower `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`, increase `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_NICE`, or set `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_IOPRIO_CLASS=3` (idle) with `COMPRESSATORIUM_TOOL_IOPRIO_LEVEL=7`.

**Docker host tips**
- Prefer SSD/cache for `CHD_TEMP_DIR` and CHD output to reduce array contention.
- Avoid running other heavy services during conversion.
- Always set container CPU/memory limits on shared hosts.

2. **Multiple Volumes:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.multi-volume.yml up -d
```

3. **CLI Batch Processing:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml up
```

### Example Configuration

## Frontend Development

The Web UI is a **Svelte 5 + Vite** single-page app. Source lives under `src/`, the build emits `index.html` plus hashed assets into `static/`, and FastAPI serves the result through the `/static` mount and a root `FileResponse`. The code follows the architecture in `DESIGN_tool_plugin_architecture.md` §3.7. A declarative tool registry (`src/lib/tools/registry.js`) drives every tool-specific decision, so adding a converter is one entry in `TOOLS` with no `if (tool === ...)` branches anywhere.

### Quick start

```bash
# Install JS deps (one-time)
npm install

# In one shell: start the FastAPI backend
./run_dev.sh                          # or: uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080

# In a second shell: start Vite with HMR
npm run dev                           # → http://localhost:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/health` to `http://localhost:8080`, so the dev server runs the SPA against the live backend with hot reload.

### Build & lint

```bash
npm run build       # Vite production build → static/index.html + static/assets/*
npm run preview     # Serve the built bundle locally on :4173
npm run lint        # ESLint (JS + .svelte), flat config in eslint.config.js
```

### Architecture at a glance

* `src/App.svelte`: the root shell. Sidebar, topbar, routed view, error boundary, focus management on route change, skip-to-content link, and the `<ModeWatcher />` (theme) and `<Toaster />` (notifications) mounts.
* `src/lib/stores/*.svelte.js`: class-singleton stores with Svelte 5 `$state` fields, one per feature domain (jobs / fileBrowser / conversion / verification / datMatching / chdMetadata / ui).
* `src/lib/api/`: REST client, auto-reconnecting EventSource (`sse.js`), and a POST-body SSE stream parser for batch verify (`sseFetch.js`). Backend snapshot-on-connect (`/api/jobs/events`) hydrates the full job state, so there's no separate REST round-trip.
* `src/lib/tools/registry.js`: every tool fact (id, label, hint, verify URL segment, source/verify exts, modes, groups, default mode, glyph, accent, **compression codecs / style / level range**, API bindings). Adding another tool is one new entry plus the backend plugin. Helpers like `registry.allFilterableExts()` keep UI surfaces (file-list filter dropdown, conversion mode dropdown, compression picker, and so on) extended automatically.
* `src/lib/components/panels/`: `VolumeList`, `Breadcrumb`, `FileList`, `FileRow`, `RowActionsMenu` (file browser); `ModeSelect`, `CompressionPicker`, `ConvertPanel` (conversion config); `JobRow`, `JobsPanel` (queue / completed / failed tabs with global Cancel-all / Clear / stuck-state recovery).
* `src/lib/components/modals/`: `BaseModal` (bits-ui Dialog wrapper), `ConfirmModal` (canonical confirm/cancel), then `BulkVerifyModal`, `DuplicateModal`, `DeleteModal`, `BulkDeleteModal`, `RenameModal`, `FileInfoModal`, `CancelAllJobsModal`, `ClearDoneModal`. Each mounts in `App.svelte` and self-renders against a `ui` store target.
* `src/lib/components/dashboard/`: `StatCard` wrapper plus `QueueSummaryCard`, `VolumeOverviewCard`, `RecentConversionsCard`, `VerificationStatusCard`, `QuickToolsCard`. QuickToolsCard iterates `registry.all()`, so adding a tool auto-adds a tile.
* `src/styles/tokens.css`: semantic design tokens keyed by `:root` (light defaults) and `:root.dark` (dark overrides). No hex colors live outside this file.

### Runtime dependencies

* [`@lucide/svelte`](https://lucide.dev): the official Lucide icon library for Svelte 5 runes, tree-shakeable per icon.
* [`bits-ui`](https://bits-ui.com): headless accessibility primitives (Dialog, DropdownMenu, ContextMenu, Tooltip, and so on). Pulled in per component as panels need them, which keeps the bundle small.
* [`svelte-sonner`](https://svelte-sonner.vercel.app): toast notifications. Call `toast.success(...)` / `toast.error(...)` / `toast.promise(...)` from anywhere. The `<Toaster />` in `App.svelte` is the surface.
* [`mode-watcher`](https://mode-watcher.sveco.dev): light/dark/system mode with localStorage persistence, system-preference tracking, and cross-tab sync. It adds the `.dark` class to `<html>`, and a matching inline script in `index.html` prevents a flash of the wrong theme on first paint.

### Docker / CI

The multi-stage `Dockerfile` has a dedicated `frontend-builder` stage that runs `npm ci && npm run build` inside `node:lts-slim`, then copies the output into the Python runtime image. The runtime image has no Node; `node:lts-slim` ships `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` so the existing multi-arch buildx pipeline keeps working unchanged.
