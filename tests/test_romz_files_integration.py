"""Regression tests for how romz interacts with the file listing.

The romz tool claims ``.7z``/``.zip`` as extract-mode inputs and ``.gb``/``.gbc``/
``.gba``/``.nds`` as compress sources. These tests pin two invariants:

1. A ``.7z``/``.zip`` produced by romz still lists as a browseable archive
   (``type == "archive"``) and is NOT marked directly convertible — the existing
   ``is_archive`` guard must win over romz's input claim, so archive browsing is
   undisturbed.
2. A loose handheld ROM is marked ``romz_convertible`` and badges its sibling
   archive output.
