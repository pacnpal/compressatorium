"""Regression: unique-name probing must not spin-loop inside a locked subtree.

When a ``folder_to_iso`` job holds a directory subtree lock (it is packing a
PS3 folder), every path *inside* that folder reports ``is_locked=True`` via the
subtree-aware ``check_file_status``. A concurrent per-file job using
``duplicate_action="rename"`` whose output lands in the folder would probe
``name_1``, ``name_2``, … — all inside the same locked subtree, all locked — so
the ``while True`` loops with no sleep, burning a thread until the dir lock
releases, then returns an arbitrarily numbered name.

A rename whose every candidate is inside a held subtree can never succeed, so it
must be rejected up front (``SkipFile(OUTPUT_LOCKED)``) like skip/overwrite do,
not spin-looped.
